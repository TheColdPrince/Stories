## google-web-stories-template

### This template provides a reference for creating and editing AMP Web Stories ([Google Stories](https://stories.google)). 

I have included notes at key points throughout the html file to help the user define excactly what AMP dictates must be present in order for a Web Story to qualify to appear in Google searches.

As of 6 October 2020, all qualifying Web Stories now have the potential to appear in the Discover section of the Google app.
Google has announced official support for the Web Stories format and plans to expand data analysis and advertising integrations accordingly.

Developer docs from [AMP](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/?format=stories) and [Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/enable-web-stories) provide additional details about creating and publishing Web Stories.

Credit for these resources goes to [amp.dev](amp.dev), where anyone who wishes to learn about Web Stories will find [Create Your First Web Story](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/start/visual_story/?format=stories), which is an interactive tutorial based on mostly the same files.
